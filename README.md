# Objective: Implement and Compare a Greedy Algorithm vs. an Exhastive Optimization Algorithm
Description: Solve the problem of finding the maximum defense a user can have given a list of armors and a budget of gold using two different algorithms, and analyze their time complexity to see which one is more feasible and practical to use.

To compile and run the program, execute the following command: make
